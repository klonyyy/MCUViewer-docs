## Variable table

There are two ways of adding variables to the table:
* Click the import variables button and select the variables from your project.
* Right click in the variable table area and select New->Variable. Set the name manually and close the window. This option can be used if your variable is not listed in the import dialog.

You can see each variable's settings by double clicking it or by right clicking and selecting Properties.
